# `Korg MA2-Blbk metronome app`

## `Overview`

This is a fun little project which brought me back to my teen years of piano education. The blue Korg MA2 metronome was a tool I used to always have with me. It keept me company during countless hours of practicing and my aim was to immortalise it in digital form, making sure it's as close to the original as possible.
